class CustomWaiter:
    """
    Base class for a custom waiter that leverages botocore's waiter code. Waiters
    poll an operation, with a specified delay between each polling attempt, until
    either an accepted result is returned or the number of maximum attempts is reached.

    To use, implement a subclass that passes the specific operation, arguments,
    and acceptors to the superclass.

    For example, to implement a custom waiter for the transcription client that
    waits for both success and failure outcomes of the get_transcription_job function,
    create a class like the following:

        class TranscribeCompleteWaiter(CustomWaiter):
        def __init__(self, client):
            super().__init__(
                'TranscribeComplete', 'GetTranscriptionJob',
                'TranscriptionJob.TranscriptionJobStatus',
                {'COMPLETED': WaitState.SUCCESS, 'FAILED': WaitState.FAILURE},
                client)

                          CamelCase.

                         dot notation. For example, 'Job.Status' will access
                         result['Job']['Status'].
        :param acceptors: The list of acceptors that indicate the wait is over. These
                          can indicate either success or failure. The acceptor values

                          argument keys are applied.
